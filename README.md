* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
* The birth of the Aave Protocol marks Aave’s shift from a decentralized P2P lending strategy (direct loan relationship
between lenders and borrowers, like in ETHLend) to a pool-based strategy. Lenders provide liquidity by depositing
cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by
placing a collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead they rely on the pooled funds, as well as
the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the
pool. A simplified scheme of the protocol is presented in figure 1 below.
Figure 1: The Aave Protocol
The interest rate for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically:
• For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the pool at a specific time.
As funds are borrowed from the pool, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate.
• For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the algorithm safeguarding a liquidity reserve
to guarantee withdrawals at any time.
